#' @description
#' A fairly random and largely unrelated assortment
#'   of different utilities that might come in useful.
#'
#' @details
#' The only "useful" functions you will find in here at
#'   the moment are \code{\link{verify}}, which is handy
#'   for checking simulation results, and \code{\link{PageRank}},
#'   a (fairly fragile!) way of scaling a matrix and computing
#'   its leading eigenvector.
