\title{Calculate nearest point in convex hull}
\usage{
nearest_point(idx, citations, communities, self = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{idx}{A journal name or index.}

\item{citations}{A square contingency table of citation data.}

\item{communities}{A membership vector or igraph \code{communities} object.}

\item{self}{logical. Include self-citations? If \code{FALSE}, they will not be counted.}
}
\description{
Given a citation matrix and a community structure, this function calculates the point
in the convex hull of community profiles that is nearest to a given journal profile.
}
\details{
This function uses quadratic programming to calculate the closest point by Euclidean distance.
The \code{citations} matrix should be arranged so that citations are directed from columns to rows.
If \code{idx} is a name, it should correspond to a row name from \code{citations}.
}
\examples{
cites <- citations[1:6, 1:6]
comms <- list(`1` = 'AoS', `2` = 'Bern', `3` = c('AmS', 'AISM', 'ANZS', 'BioJ'))
nearest_point('AoS', cites, comms) # Inside hull (value == 0), because AoS is itself a community.
nearest_point('ANZS', cites, comms) # Outside hull, near to its own community.
